<h4><b><i>The Mercedes-Benz W210 is the internal designation for a range of executive cars manufactured by Mercedes-Benz and marketed under the E-Class model name in both sedan/saloon (1995–2002) and station wagon/estate (1996–2003) configurations. W210 development started in 1988, three years after the W124's introduction.

    The W210 was designed by Steve Mattin under design chief Bruno Sacco between 1988 and 1991, later being previewed on the 1993 Coupé Concept shown at the Geneva Auto Show in March 1993. The W210 was the first Mercedes-Benz production car featuring Xenon headlamps (including dynamic headlamp range control, only low beam).[12]
    
    Design patent and facelift
    Design patents for both the Coupé Concept and the W210 E-Class were filed on 25 February 1993 in Germany and 25 August 1993 in the US.[13][14][15][16][17][18] On 21 July 1998, design patents were filed on an updated W210 (designed in 1997).[19][20][21]
    
    For model year 2000, a multi-function information system was incorporated into the instrument cluster below the speedometer, and the introduction of steering wheel controls for the audio/navigation/phone system. In addition, the 5-speed automatic transmission introduced +/- gate positions for semi-manual control of the gearbox, marketed as "Touch Shift." This electronic system replaced the previous gated shift arrangement. Exterior changes included a revised front with a steeper rake, similar to the CLK, and restyled bumpers and lower body trim. Sedans received new taillights, and the wagon's tailgate was revised, moving the CHMSL from the base of the rear window to directly above it. The final W210 production included the E 320 and E 430 special editions released in two exterior colors - quartz silver (limited edition), obsidian black, and with Xenon lights, 17-inch alloy wheels and black maple walnut trim. Estate cars (sedans optionally) had Citroën-like self-leveling rear suspension with suspension struts rather than shock absorbers, gas-filled suspension spheres to provide damping and an under bonnet pressurizing pump. Unlike the traditional Citroën application Mercedes opted for a fixed ride height and employed rear coil springs to maintain the static ride height when parked.

    This was the first time a V6 engine was offered (model year 1998) to replace the straight-six configuration (1995–1997). This new Mercedes-Benz M112 engine produced 165 kW (224 PS; 221 hp) and 315 N⋅m (232 lb⋅ft) of torque and offered a 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) of 6.9 seconds. Other offerings were the E 420 (1997), E 430 (1998–2002), and E 55 AMG (1999–2002) with 260 kW (354 PS; 349 hp)[22] and a 5.4 L naturally aspirated engine. In North America, the range also features two diesels, including both non-turbocharged (1996–1997) and turbocharged (1998–1999) 3.0 litre straight-six units, that were internally designated as OM606.
    
    In 1999, Mercedes-Benz discontinued diesel powerplants in the E-class in North America. In Europe, the diesel engines were superseded by more advanced Common Rail (CDI) units (2000–2002). The CDI engines were not offered in North America until the E 320 CDI in the newer W211 model.
